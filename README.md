# gradebook-name-list

My wife teaches fourth grade and still uses the standard gradebook for 
recording her students' grades.  However, with students moving in and 
out of her classroom, the list of names is always in flux.  I built this 
project as a response to her desire to have a more clean-looking class list in
her gradebook.

### Usage

Just type in the spaces!  If you want to print the green and white bars,
you'll need to use firefox and enable background image printing.
